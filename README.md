# Machine Learning SageMaker Project
### Generative AI Labs and Model Deployments using AWS SageMaker

This project is inspired by the AWS Immersion Day format and is aimed at helping users get started with Generative AI using AWS services, especially SageMaker. It is structured into four main modules, each combining theoretical background (via slides) and practical hands-on labs (via Jupyter notebooks).

### üß† Modules Included:
1. **Introduction to Generative AI & Large Language Models**
   - Model deployment and inference optimization
2. **Finetuning Large Language Models**
3. **Visual Foundation Models**
   - Stable Diffusion deployment and inference
4. **Building GenAI Applications**
   - Engineering GenAI-powered apps using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

> Note: During workshops or personal learning sessions, you may choose to cover only a subset of these modules.

Amazon SageMaker Studio Access: Amazon SageMaker Studio is a web-based, integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning that lets you build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your machine learning models. Studio provides all the tools you need to take your models from experimentation to production while boosting your productivity.

If the AWS Account has been provisioned by your AWS Instructor, follow the next steps to access the SageMaker Studio environment:

Open AWS console and switch to AWS region communicated by your instructor. 

You can find the list of the AWS regions that support SageMaker Studio [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio.html).

![Management Console](./img/mgmtConsole.png)

Under services search for Amazon SageMaker.

![SageMaker](./img/sagemaker.png)

Under Get Started, click on the orange button SageMaker Studio.

![SageMaker Studio](./img/sagemakerStudio.png)

A SageMaker Studio environment should already be provisioned. Click on Open Studio (on the right side of the preprovisioned sagemakeruser username).

![SageMaker Domain](./img/sagemakerDomain.png)

The page can take 1 or 2 minutes to load when you access SageMaker Studio for the first time.

![SageMaker loading](./img/sagemakerLoading.png)

You will be redirected to a new web tab that looks like the below figure. Click Open Launcher.

![SageMaker start](./img/openLauncher.png)

Under Notebooks and compute resources, make sure that the Data Science SageMaker image is selected and click on Notebook - Python 3.

![Notebooks & Compute resources](./img/notebooksComputeResources.png)

You will land in the Untitled.ipynb notebook.

![Untitled](./img/untitled.png)

You can rename the notebook by right clicking on the name.

![Rename file](./img/renameFile.png)

Congratulations!! You have successfully launched a SageMaker Studio Notebook and are now familiar with the basic flow within Sagemaker Studio. You will not need this specific notebook for the upcoming labs, however you can use the exact same notebook configuration (instance, image) throughout the upcoming labs.

# Downloading the content of the GitHub repository needed for the labs

## Clone Repository

```console
!git clone https://github.com/aristsakpinis93/generative-ai-immersion-day
